# PortFolio-App
For all you beginners in programming, creating a portfolio app as your initial nodejs projects for beginners will be an apt idea. Here, you can first concentrate on the outlook of the application which means how it looks and how are the sample projects working out. This app can reveal your personal sense of style as well.

There are multiple elements you can use to give a good experience to user, like presenting the application and the output with a good appearance.

The next thing you have to work on is the architecture of the whole project. It includes the code you are writing to make a light-weight and easy to use application. Also, you have to first define separate routes for each project.

Node.js has different set of controllers for each route to manage the views. If you have the same code for the header and footer then you donâ€™t have to repeat them which come as a benefit for the programmers.
